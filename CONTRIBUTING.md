# Contributing

To contribute, open an issue or make a pull request!

Note - this is not a help forum. If you want technical support, ask us on [our Discord chat](https://discord.gg/qZYj5Ga).

## When contributing:
- Make sure you understand the scope of what you plan to contribute
- Consider opening an issue to discuss your contribution with us before making a pull request
- Lint your code with revive (I use a git pre commit hook for this)
- Test your code, and optimally attempt to fix the failures
- Delete any builds of your code that you might accidentally add (usually named `main`)
- Only bugfix commits may be pushed directly to the master branch.
- PRs to master branch must pass CI with no errors, and must be reviewed by another dev. Warnings are permissible, but should be reviewed
- Don't hesitate to raise on issue if a bug or a security concern is found, especially an the master branch
